                    I'm an avid farmer. The connection between farming and IT might not be apparent but Information
                    Technology can not only improve efficiency but also help
                    farmers to make their lives easier and their operations cheaper.<br />
                    Farm smart, not hard.

                Information Technology has always played a big role in my life. As a 90’s kid, I grew up with the first affordable computers and video game consoles, the internet broke through and my interest in IT was sparked. At that time, I had my first experiences HTML & PHP.
                With the vast development of IT within the last 15 years (introduction of the iPhone, HighSpeed Internet, Cloud Computing, automatisation, IoT & MachineLearning) and inspiring people like Steve Jobs, my view on IT shifted from being a fun and entertaining technology to being an opportunity for many people and companies to make their lives and work easier.
                However, I wasn’t going to be part of the IT development and I wasn’t going to help anyone, I was a user. I used IT as a main source of information, as a music producer and DJ and I acquired basic knowledge in HTML & CSS and eventually started to program or design small business websites and converted training material in a web-format for an IT-Training company. Furthermore, I used IT in my trade as an electritian and finally to manage a farm. 
                While I used a lot of IT and researched for various solutions in different areas of life, I started to realise that I want to be part of the development and that I want to provide those solutions which I could not find or only fragments which would require to use many different applications.
                Most recently, I have started to learn Python and I’ve been working on my first projects with the Raspberry Pi. This was the first step towards creating solutions for myself. The studies in information technology will help me to gain knowledge and provide solutions for a broader audience.
            </p>

                The RMIT together with OpenUniversity gives me the opportunity to study anywhere at anytime while I work or travel in Australia. I would not be able to afford presence-studies, and the last option would be to go back to Germany. Students hardly have to pay for studies there, at all. Australia, with its people, beaches and sun makes my life more enjoyable and with the option to study online, it also gives me the opportunity to grow professionally.
             </p>
             <p>   
                During my studies I expect to develop a good foundation for my further career. I would like to get a broad insight into the general field of IT and a more detailed knowledge about software programming / developing (cloud/browser based as well as mobile and computer applications). I hope to acquire a skillset which allows me to work on small to medium projects which include hard- and software and the communication between them, later in my career I’d like to be able to work on large and complex projects.
