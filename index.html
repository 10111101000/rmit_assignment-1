                    I'm an avid farmer. The connection between farming and IT might not be apparent but Information
                    Technology can not only improve efficiency but also help
                    farmers to make their lives easier and their operations cheaper.<br />
                    Farm smart, not hard.

            <p>
              Information Technology has always played a big role in my life. As a 90’s kid, I grew up with the first
              affordable computers and video game consoles, the internet broke through and my interest in IT was
              sparked. At that time, I had my first experiences HTML & PHP.
              With the vast development of IT within the last 15 years (introduction of the iPhone, HighSpeed Internet,
              Cloud Computing, automatisation, IoT & MachineLearning) and inspiring people like Steve Jobs, my view on
              IT shifted from being a fun and entertaining technology to being an opportunity for many people and
              companies to make their lives and work easier.
              However, I wasn’t going to be part of the IT development and I wasn’t going to help anyone, I was a user.
              I used IT as a main source of information, as a music producer and DJ and I acquired basic knowledge in
              HTML & CSS and eventually started to program or design small business websites and converted training
              material in a web-format for an IT-Training company. Furthermore, I used IT in my trade as an electritian
              and finally to manage a farm.
              While I used a lot of IT and researched for various solutions in different areas of life, I started to
              realise that I want to be part of the development and that I want to provide those solutions which I could
              not find or only fragments which would require to use many different applications.
              Most recently, I have started to learn Python and I’ve been working on my first projects with the
              Raspberry Pi. This was the first step towards creating solutions for myself. The studies in information
              technology will help me to gain knowledge and provide solutions for a broader audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The RMIT together with OpenUniversity gives me the opportunity to study anywhere at anytime while I work
              or travel in Australia. I would not be able to afford presence-studies, and the last option would be to go
              back to Germany. Students hardly have to pay for studies there, at all. Australia, with its people,
              beaches and sun makes my life more enjoyable and with the option to study online, it also gives me the
              opportunity to grow professionally.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my studies I expect to develop a good foundation for my further career. I would like to get a broad
              insight into the general field of IT and a more detailed knowledge about software programming / developing
              (cloud/browser based as well as mobile and computer applications). I hope to acquire a skillset which
              allows me to work on small to medium projects which include hard- and software and the communication
              between them, later in my career I’d like to be able to work on large and complex projects.

            <h4>
              The meaning of the test results to me
            </h4>
            <p>
              To begin with, I was suprised how accurate these results were. I mainly agree to many of the attributes
              assigned to me. The results clarified characteristics which I have not thought about before and they have
              made
              clear where I can put my focus in order to improve weaknesses and strenghten my existing strong points.
            </p>
            <h4>
              The influence of the results on my behaviour in a team
            </h4>
            <p>
              The results of these tests will help me to infuence my behaviour in a team positvely. Being aware of my
              strong
              and not so strong points should enable me to consider those in communication, planning and execution. It
              should also help
              me to find my position in a team as well as control my sensitivity, self-esteem, idealism and support me
              in decision making
              processes.
            </p>
            <h4>
              The way I should take this into account when forming a team
            </h4>
            <p>
              To use my strongest points in a team efficiently, I should find a leading / planning role in a team.
              Members of the team should complement my skillsset (be strong in decision making processes,
              good in communication and willing to finish their part of the project). To learn personally and therefore
              improve the outcome of projects, the members should be able to communicate verbaly. Roles and workload
              should
              be clearly distributed to avoid me taking on other people's work.
