                    I'm an avid farmer. The connection between farming and IT might not be apparent but Information
                    Technology can not only improve efficiency but also help
                    farmers to make their lives easier and their operations cheaper.<br />
                    Farm smart, not hard.

            <h4>
              General interest in IT
            </h4>
            <p>
              Information Technology has always played a big role in my life. As a 90’s kid, I grew up with the first
              affordable computers and video game consoles, the internet broke through and my interest in IT was
              sparked. At that time, I had my first experiences HTML & PHP.
              With the vast development of IT within the last 15 years (introduction of the iPhone, HighSpeed Internet,
              Cloud Computing, automatisation, IoT & MachineLearning) and inspiring people like Steve Jobs, my view on
              IT shifted from being a fun and entertaining technology to being an opportunity for many people and
              companies to make their lives and work easier.
              However, I wasn’t going to be part of the IT development and I wasn’t going to help anyone, I was a user.
              I used IT as a main source of information, as a music producer and DJ and I acquired basic knowledge in
              HTML & CSS and eventually started to program or design small business websites and converted training
              material in a web-format for an IT-Training company. Furthermore, I used IT in my trade as an electritian
              and finally to manage a farm.
              While I used a lot of IT and researched for various solutions in different areas of life, I started to
              realise that I want to be part of the development and that I want to provide those solutions which I could
              not find or only fragments which would require to use many different applications.
              Most recently, I have started to learn Python and I’ve been working on my first projects with the
              Raspberry Pi. This was the first step towards creating solutions for myself. The studies in information
              technology will help me to gain knowledge and provide solutions for a broader audience.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Why RMIT?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The RMIT together with OpenUniversity gives me the opportunity to study anywhere at anytime while I work
              or travel in Australia. I would not be able to afford presence-studies, and the last option would be to go
              back to Germany. Students hardly have to pay for studies there, at all. Australia, with its people,
              beaches and sun makes my life more enjoyable and with the option to study online, it also gives me the
              opportunity to grow professionally.
            </p>
            <h4>
              My expectations of the studies
            </h4>
            <p>
              During my studies I expect to develop a good foundation for my further career. I would like to get a broad
              insight into the general field of IT and a more detailed knowledge about software programming / developing
              (cloud/browser based as well as mobile and computer applications). I hope to acquire a skillset which
              allows me to work on small to medium projects which include hard- and software and the communication
              between them. Later in my career, I’d like to be able to work on large and complex projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              The major skills I hope to acquire knowlege in:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                general IT in its hardware components
              </li>
              <li>
                a good, technical foundation in programming (logical & analytical thinking)
              </li>
              <li>
                programming languages, which help me to build up a solid foundation to work in software engineering

              <li>
                general logical & analytical thinking

                the abbility to work in a team and in a position as a team leader
              </li>
              <li>
                the ability to cope with pressure and deadlines
              </li>
              <li>
                ethical positive and negative aspects of IT

                  <hr>
                  <p>
                    This advertisement is seeking for a full stack developer.<br />
                    The company is looking for a person to contribute to the integration of their own IoT products to
                    different platforms like iOS and Android.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The exciting part of this position is not to be a part of a development of some random smartphone
                    apps, but the development of a useful tool
                    which helps making people's lives easier. An example for that can be seen <a
                      href="https://rainharvesting.com.au/products/digital-tank-gauge/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
                    Being a part of a team which enables people to spend time on more important things, like families
                    and personal development rather than checking the levels of water tanks,
                    causes pleasure for me and fulfills my need to help people and develop solutions for a fast growing,
                    technological world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This position doesn't necessarily require a degree or diploma. However, extensive knowledge in HTML,
                    CSS and SASS (another Style Sheet Language) as well as JavaScript and jQuery
                    is needed.<br />
                    A good knowledge in Amazon Web Services (AWS) is as important as a good knowlege in Amazon's
                    DynamoDB.<br />
                    Foundation knowledge with front end technologies and the integration of payment platforms are also
                    compulsory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My current skill set certainly doesn't match the ad.<br />
                    I do have a basic knowledge in HTMl, CSS and JavaScript, but this is reduced to the basic structure
                    of all of them. A developer in this position should be able to
                    write the most of the code without using Docs. While I know the structure and principles, there is a
                    long journey for me to become proficient and confident in writing
                    code professionally.<br />
                    I'm also lacking on knowledge in AWS and the experience with the integration of payment platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The studies at RMIT will enable me to match these requirements. There might be a gap in AWS and
                    special technologies like SASS but after my studies in
                    Information Technology, I will be able to fill these gaps in no time by using MOOC.<br />
                    However, I see myself rather in an entrepreneur position in IT. <br />
                    For that, I don't only have to gain knowledge on the technical side of IT (programming, different
                    languages etc), but also improve my leadership and team skills.

              The meaning of the test results to me
            </h4>
            <p>
              To begin with, I was surprised how accurate these results were. I mainly agree to many of the attributes
              assigned to me. The results clarified characteristics which I have not thought about before and they have
              made
              clear where I can put my focus in order to improve weaknesses and strenghten my existing strong points.
            </p>
            <h4>
              The influence of the results on my behaviour in a team
            </h4>
            <p>
              The results of these tests will help me to infuence my behaviour in a team positvely. Being aware of my
              strong
              and not so strong points should enable me to consider those in communication, planning and execution. It
              should also help
              me to find my position in a team as well as control my sensitivity, self-esteem, idealism and support me
              in decision making
              processes.
            </p>
            <h4>
              The way I should take this into account when forming a team
            </h4>
            <p>
              To use my strongest points in a team efficiently, I should find a leading / planning role in a team.
              Members of the team should complement my skillset (be strong in decision making processes,
              good in communication and willing to finish their part of the project). To learn personally and therefore
              improve the outcome of projects, the members should be able to communicate verbaly. Roles and workload
              should
              be clearly distributed to avoid me taking on other people's work.

              Overview
            </h4>
            <p>
              This project will be a modular, web based application with a hardware integration to manage, monitor and
              improve farming practises and calculations of
              feed demand & cost according to set weight gains of beef cattle. The project will combine tools which are
              already available as well as new instruments
              which have not or not optimally been utilised before. It will also enable farmers to upgrade their
              existing equipment with sensors and user interfaces
              to make it smarter.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Motivation
            </h4>
            <p>
              With a rapidly growing population and recurring extreme weather events, farming has been getting tougher
              and more competitive while the demand of food grows, and the accessability of land declines. Many small
              to medium primary producers are using fertilisers, seeds and pesticides or other resources like fuel for
              their animals - as they have for decades. New technologies allow us to improve the efficiency and
              precision
              in landwork and animal production drastically at reasonable cost. To enable farmers to save money while
              increasing profit and production output, web based technologies like HTML, JavaScript and databases in
              combination with hardware which uses GPS, LoRa, weight measurement-systems or other sensors should be
              used.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Description
            </h4>
            <p>
              This web based solution, which will also be accessable via iOS and Android, will cover the need of the
              modern farmer from A to Z.
              For example, the feed calculator for cattle to match a definied weight gain. It
              will calculate the nutritional demand (energy and protein)
              depending on the weight, age, weather condition and other circumstances like pregnancy or lactation and
              find the best feed plan for the animal. While it does these calculation,
              it will also consider the cost of different products and choose the cheapest option for the farmer while
              keeping the welfare of the animal in mind.<br />
              A second major feature will be the implementation of sensors, actors and displays to save resources and
              time. Many agricultural implements which are being used by small to
              medium producers work in a very simple way. A seeder, for instance, has got a little window on the side of
              the seed box, but does not tell the operator when the box is empty.
              Optical sensors combined with little graphical user interfaces can not only provide feedback to the
              operator but even learn about the machine and the output of resources at
              different settings. The same principle can be used to integrate flow sensors and pressure regulators for
              sprayer units.<br />
              Measuring and calculating is only one part of the system. An intelligent backend will store data and use
              it to suggest settings or timings. For instance, a weather module which uses
              external data in the beginning but learns from local weather collected by a hardware module will
              be able to give the farmer a good outlook for the long term weather.
              The feed calculator works in a similar way. Different breeds of cattle in different areas convert feed
              differently. If they don’t perform as expected, the software will either increase
              or decrease values to adjust to the breed and environment.
              All those information will be stored locally but synchronised to a cloud. To access the data or to put in
              more data, little displays can be installed at different places on the
              farm and in machines. These displays will have various working windows, depending on the task which is
              being performed. At the grain or hay storage, for instance, the interface
              will tell the user which quantities are required for which mobs. The scale, in turn, will be able to tell
              the interface the quantities fed, and adjust the inventory accordingly.
              The more of these units are used, the more information can be extracted and the more precise and helpful
              the system will get.<br />
              Another feature will be a time tracking system. Especially when different people work on the farm, time
              tracking can be very valuable. It will allow to keep track of working
              hours which than helps for payments and it will also allow to record times for different tasks, in
              different
              paddocks etc. and therefore help the manager to manage time more
              efficiently and precisely. The data will be entered via user access to the web interface, app or on the
              little workstation displays.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Tools and Technologies
            </h4>
            <p>
              On the software side of this project, technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Databases are vital for
              the front- and backend. Java is needed for the Android app, Swift is necessary for the iOS app. Additional
              frameworks like Bootstrap and libraries like jQuery are helpful for the GUI & DOM.
              The project includes various sensors: optical / ultrasonic sensors, pressure and flow sensors as well as
              weight sensors and those to identify position, altitude and speed (GNASS).
              Data in- and output will be realised with Raspberry PIs and Arduinos and compatible touch- and segment
              displays.
              The transmission of information can be done by using LoRa components.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Required Skills
            </h4>
            <p>
              To develop the brain & interface for human interaction (the browser based application - front & backend),
              a solid knowledge in HTML and JavaScript in combination with databases (MongoDB) is required. A good
              knowledge about jQuery and Bootstrap will accelerate the programming.
              To utilise smartphones, a solid base in Java and Swift is required.
              Extensive research as well as experience in farming provide the base for the feed calculation module and
              the integration of sensors.
              Mathematics is a major part of the project, however, algebra and elements of curve sketching will be
              sufficient.<br />
              The hardware (sensors, mini computers and displays) is very common and easily to source. At a later stage,
              the hardware might be replaced by tailor-made products to reduce cost.
              All the technologies used are widly spread and easily accessible. A lot of them work similar and the
              knowledge is, with enough time, easily acquirable.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Outcome
            </h4>
            <p>
              If the project is successful, primary producers will reduce the usage of human- and natural resources and
              therefore:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                reduce the strain on the environment<br />
                (reduced fertiliser usage and feed wastage, less usage of oils & fuels, diminished or eliminated need to
                buy new equipment)
              </li>
              <li>
                produce more efficiently<br />
                (smart technologies which 1. reduce time in the paddock and in the office, 2. a measurable and
                repeatable performance of the animals, 3. maybe an increase of animal capacities)
              </li>
              <li>
                increase the profit<br />
                (surplus production in pasture which can be baled and sold, more production in beef, less cost in
                resources)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This will enable the producer to be more competitive and to grow with the higher demand.
